# GKS ASHG 2024 Unconference

Welcome to the repository for GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Unconference.

We will be hosting a unconference as an ancillary event at
[ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/2024meeting/) on Monday, November 4th, 2024 from
8 AM - 4 PM. **Registration is free!** The location is at the Hyatt Regency Denver at
Colorado Convention Center in room Mineral A. This repository will contain project
proposals from registered unconference participants.

## Participation Application and Selection

We have 16 spots left and **registration is free!** Spots will be allocated on a
first-come, first-served basis. Please fill out
[this](https://forms.gle/DE7sMXLUCzHQhaJx6) application form ASAP to secure your spot.
Only those who complete the form will be eligible to participate. You will be notified
via email within 1-3 business days if you've secured a spot. We'd love to see you there!

## Project Proposals

To propose a project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yaml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the repository
[proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues)
and express your interest in proposed unconference projects with
[reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the unconference to give a brief
brief pitch. After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the
proposals that generate the most interest and engagement.
